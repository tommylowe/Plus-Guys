The Positive Website is designed to make and keep anyone happy. My partner and I just wanted to make someone else's day better than what it was. Making our actual website was not that difficult, but it was time consuming. The hardest part was making the entire website responsive. I wish we would've had just a little more time.  -Tommy Lowe




My website is about showing positivity. The process of making my website wasn't bad, it just took time. I kind of wish I had an extra week and everything would have been absolutely perfect. The part that took the most time was making it responsive. The nav bar was probably the hardest part because we had messed something up in our css, but once we fixed it everything was straight.   -Jeremiah Brawner
