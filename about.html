     <h3>
      <p>We are two guys from a small city who have realized the world around us isn't at its best without positivity. What people fail to realize is that there is love everywhere in this world. Regardless of where you come from you can always defeat the odds and become the best you to the best of your abilities, as long as you try your best. The key to becoming postive is consistency. Try telling someone they look nice every day or even telling your teachers how thankful you are of them. Praise people even when no one is looking. If you see someone getting bullied try and help diffuse the situation.  Being a consistent positive person can change someone's life in a heartbeat, because if they see you doing right they may also want to do right. As Sean Maguire once said, "some peope can't believe in themselves until someone believes in them first."
